# Why I Stopped Running Traditional Drills – And What I Do Instead
### How To Transform Traditional Drills Into Game-Like Small-Sided Games That Transfer To Real Basketball

> My players looked great in drills.
> Calm. Controlled. Precise.
> Then game day came — and everything fell apart.

They missed reads they had “mastered” in practice.  
They hesitated under pressure.  
They struggled to apply skills once defenders, time, and chaos entered the picture.

For a long time, I blamed execution.  
In reality, the problem was how we trained.

  <p>
    This is not an attack on fundamentals.<br /> It’s about <strong>why traditional drills alone don’t transfer</strong> — and how [small-sided games](/ssg-playbook) can bridge the gap between practice and real basketball.

## 1. The Traditional Practice Routines We Grew Up With

Most basketball practices still follow familiar routines.  
Drills many of us grew up with — 3-man weaves, shell drills, passing lines — clean, organized, and easy to control.

- players in lines
- rehearsed patterns
- no defenders
- no decisions

These drills feel productive because they look clean.  
Everyone knows where to go.  
The ball moves. The spacing is correct. The execution feels sharp.

And that’s the problem.

Traditional drills remove exactly the elements that define basketball:  
**pressure, perception, and decision-making**.

> That doesn’t make these drills wrong.
> It simply means they train execution without context.

And basketball is never played without context.

## 2. Why Traditional Drills Don’t Transfer to Games

In real games, players must:

- read defenders
- adapt to space
- make decisions under time pressure
- live with consequences

In most drills, they don’t.

You can perfect a pass in a 2v0 drill —
but the moment a defender takes away the obvious option, that “perfect” skill collapses.

>Skills don’t fail in games — decisions do.

This is why players often look worse in games than in practice.
We trained the movement, but not the problem the movement was meant to solve.

*(If you want the deeper learning theory behind this, I break it down in detail in my article on the [Constraints-Led Approach](/blog/constraints-led-approach))*

## 3. My Turning Point as a Coach

At some point, I realized something uncomfortable:

I was spending most of practice time on activities that could never happen in a real game.

So I changed one thing:  
I stopped asking *“Does this drill look good?”*  
and started asking *“Does this situation exist in basketball?”*

That question changed everything.

## 4. What Small-Sided Games Actually Train

Small-sided games (SSGs) don’t just “add fun” to practice.  
They change what players are learning.

In SSGs, players train:  
- technique under pressure
- perception and scanning
- decision-making
- spacing and timing
- communication

And they train all of it at the same time.

That’s the key difference.

## 5. The Core Shift: From Drills to Games

This is where most coaches get stuck.

They think switching to small-sided games means throwing away all drills.  
It doesn’t.

> Don’t delete your drills — evolve them.

**Examples:**


The structure stays.  
But now players must read, decide, and adapt.

This is where real transfer begins.

## 6. The 3 Rules That Make Any Small-Sided Game Work

If you remember only one thing, remember this:

<div class="protip"> 
<strong>Every effective SSG includes:</strong><br /> 1️⃣ A defender<br /> 2️⃣ A decision<br /> 3️⃣ A consequence </div>

Remove one of these, and learning drops instantly.

## 7. Common Mistakes Coaches Make With SSGs

Small-sided games fail when:

- there are too many rules
- the goal isn’t clear
- coaches over-instruct
- the game doesn’t punish bad decisions

> Small-sided games are not chaos.
> Bad design is.

## 8. How I Coach During Small-Sided Games

My role changed completely.

- less talking
- more observing
- short, targeted interventions
- questions instead of commands

When players struggle, I don’t explain more —  
**I change the environment**.

*(You’ll find many examples of this approach in the [Drills section](/drills) of my website.)*

  <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
  <p>
    Add a constraint when:
    <ul>
      <li>Traditional drills don’t fail — they just don’t finish the job</li>
      <li>Small-sided games create real transfer</li>
      <li>Decisions matter more than perfect form</li>
      <li>Learning looks messy — and that’s okay</li>
      <li>Practice should feel like the game</li>
    </ul>
    That’s your signal to change the <strong>environment</strong>, not the <strong>instruction</strong>.
